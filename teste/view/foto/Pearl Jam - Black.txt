[Primeira Parte]

  E7          E4(7/9)   A5/E
Sheets of empty        canvas
   E4(7/9)  E7        E4(7/9)  A6/E  A5/E
Untouched sheets of clay
      E7              E  A
Were laid spread out be_fore me
    E7
As her body once did

E7        E4(7/9)  A5/E
All five ho_______rizons
   E4(7/9)  E7              E4(7/9)
Revolved    around her soul
A6/E                      A5/E
     As the earth to the sun, yeah
 E7         E  A
Now the air I tasted and breathed
 E7
Has taken a turn

[Pré-Refrão]

C
Mmm, and all I taught her was
       Em
Everything
C                                 Em
Mmm, how quick the sun can drop away?

[Refrão]

            D
And now my bitter hands
         C
Cradle broken glass
                   Em
Of what was everything
         D
Oh, the pictures have
          C
All been washed in black
                Em
Tattooed everything

[Segunda Parte]

E7        E4(7/9)  A5/E
   I take a       walk outside
E4(7/9) E7         E4(7/9)  A6/E    A5/E
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E7           E   A
I can feel their laughter
      E7
So, why do I sear?

[Pré-Refrão]

C
Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin
          Em
Round my head
                        C
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
                             Em
How quick the sun can drop away?

[Refrão]

            D

Cradle broken glass
                   Em
Of what was everything
         D
Oh, the pictures have
          C
All been washed in black
                Em
Tattooed everything
         D
All the love gone bad
           C
Turned my world to black
             D
Tattooed all I see
         C
All that I am

In somebody else's sky
